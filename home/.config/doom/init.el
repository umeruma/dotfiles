;;; $DOOMDIR/init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load
;; in. Remember to run 'doom sync' after modifying it!

;; NOTE: Press 'SPC h d h' (or 'C-h d h' for non-vim users) to access Doom's
;;   documentation. There you'll find a link to Doom's Module Index where all of
;;   our modules are listed, including what flags they support.

;; NOTE: Move your cursor over a module's name (or its flags) and press 'K' (or
;;   'C-c c k' for non-vim users) to view its documentation. This works on flags
;;   as well (those symbols that start with a plus).
;;
;;   Alternatively, press 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') on a module to browse its
;;   directory (for easy access to its source code).
